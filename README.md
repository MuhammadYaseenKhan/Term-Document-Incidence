# Term-Document-Incidence

This is a breif demo for the construction of Term-Document-Incidence using with and without Python.

For the example, we have a tsv file (urdu-sentiment-corpus-v1.tsv) having 2 things at every line "sentence" followed by a separtaing tab and a "label" in the end.

The consturction of the TDI will employe the sentences in the file (as we have to eliminate the label in the end).
